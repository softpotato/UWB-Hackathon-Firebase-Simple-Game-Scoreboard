# UWB-Hackathon-Firebase-Simple-Game-Scoreboard
This is a simple scoreboard made in Google's Firebase server. This is a single global function that activates on input. It reads from
the realtime database and it looks for a new file with 2 members inside, userName and score. It also expects another folder with highscores
with a similar list of folders with a score and userName data members inside.

## Additional Note
This code was not used in the final iteration of the game. The game largely operates on it's own and doesn't rely heavily on cloud related functions.
